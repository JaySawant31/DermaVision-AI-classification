# _Dermatological Disease Classification using Vision-based Deep Learning_


## Introduction

This repository contains all the codes for a project that aims to classifiy cutanoeus or skin diseases using pre-trained Deep-Learning models like ResNet-18, ResNet-50, VGG-16, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0. The dataset is in the form of real-time taken skin image lesions. More information about the availabilty/procurement of the dataset is also provided. Data Augmentation techniques namely Basic Augmentation, Convolutional Autoencoder, and Wasserstein GANs to generate images have also been included in this repository since the initial dataset that is available is a very small one (50 images per class across 4 classes).

## What are Cutaneous Diseases?

Cutaneous Diseases or skin disorders are conditions that affect the skin, nails, and related tissues. Various factors are involved in causing these. 

## Problem Statement

Classification of skin diseases helps in early and accurate diagnosis, enabling timely and appropriate treatment. It also aids in standardizing care and improving clinical decision-making. Timely diagnosis becomes an important factor considering the fact that these diseases need to receive prompt medication to curb their spread. 

## Our Approach

We utilized real-time images of skin diseases and created a curated dataset to perform classification of cutaneous diseases based on four classes namely: _Herpes Simplex, Herpes Zoster, Molluscum Contagiosum, and Non-Viral_. The images were collected by Dr. Sushil Savant, MD Dermatologist, our collaborator in this project during his Masters Thesis at Katihar Medical College and Hospital, Bihar, India. Five neural network architectures whose names have been mentioned earlier were modified to be trained and tested on this curated dataset. 

The methodology adopted to extract lesions for creating our dataset from the original images is depicted in the diagram shown below:

A basic methodology pipeline adopted in this approach is depcited using a block diagram shown below:

Instead of labelling all the data manually, we select features using *submodlib*. The extracted features are then used for the desired task using pre-trained Deep Learning Models. To evaluate the images generated by the generative models, we primarily use the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) to compute similarity between the original and generated images. It essentially measures how similar the generated images are to real-world images. Lower FID scores indicate better image quality and a closer resemblance to real images. For added comparison metrics, we have also included the PSNR and SSIM calculation scripts in [Image_Similarity_Comparison](https://github.com/JaySawant31/DermaVision-AI-classification/tree/main/Image_Similarity_Comparison).  

## Dataset Availability

The dataset created specifically for this use is __*first of its kind*__ and is available on request at nitichikhale19@gmail.com or sushilsavant786@gmail.com. Make sure to include a short abstract or introduction to the research study/project you are going to perform using this data for us to evaluate the dataset requirement.

## Repository Contents
